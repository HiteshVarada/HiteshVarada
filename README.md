Hey there, lovely people! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hitesh, and I promise my sense of humor is almost as good as my data skills. Thanks for stopping by my GitHub!

I have a Master's Degree in Information Technology from Central Michigan University. If you thought that was fancy, wait until you hear the rest.

Iâ€™m a Data Analyst with over 4 years of experience, currently dazzling minds at Cerebra Consulting as a Business Intelligence Analyst. My skills are like a buffet of programming languages â€“ Python, R, and my newest crush, C# .NET for building Web APIs. I can charm the data out of PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL Server, Oracle, and Azure Data Studio like a magician pulling rabbits out of hats.

Now, querying and programming might be the bread and butter of a Data Analyst, but let's face it â€“ without the ability to convey findings to the technically savvy and the "whatâ€™s a spreadsheet?" crowd alike, itâ€™s like baking a cake and forgetting the icing. So, Iâ€™ve equipped myself with BI tools like Power BI, Tableau, Qlik, Superset, and good olâ€™ Excel to make those data stories shine.

Every day is a learning journey for me, except when itâ€™s a revision journey. Sometimes, I like to revisit my skills by building projects that remind me just how awesome I am (humble, I know).

Speaking of learning, Iâ€™m currently diving into the world of LLMs (Large Language Models). Because, why not?

So, if you're a recruiter or a professional looking for someone who can mix humor with hardcore data analysis, youâ€™ve found your guy. Letâ€™s turn data into delightful insights and have some laughs along the way!
